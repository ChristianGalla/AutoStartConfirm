## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a vulnerability, please use the default GitHub feature
https://github.com/ChristianGalla/AutoStartConfirm/security/advisories/new
for secure communication.

This is a private, open source, non-profit side project of only one maintainer.

I try to respond as soon as possible (usually in a few days),
but for example if I am busy or on vacation it could take up to a few weeks until a vulnerability is closed.
